🧾 Project: Handling Missing Values in Datasets

I’m working on Python projects that focus on handling missing values in datasets using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
In this project, I’ve applied various techniques to manage missing data effectively, including:

Dropping rows with missing values

Dropping columns with more than 70% missing data

Filling with constant values

Replacing with Mean (numeric) and Mode (categorical)

Replacing with Median (numeric) and Mode (categorical)

KNN Imputation

Iterative Imputation (MICE)

Domain-based (Alley) Imputation

Adding Missing Indicators

These approaches help improve data quality and ensure better model performance during data analysis and machine learning.
